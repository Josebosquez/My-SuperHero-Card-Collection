### Introduction

This read me file explains how this site is best utilized in order to provide a friendly user experience.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important things to know: 

- Dont ask me how, and dont ask me why but.....Please find a extension that utilizes CORS. It will be required for this website to work. Link that i used is below. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc. Rarely, JSON information will get lost in web space and it wont work after waiting 20 seconds. Refresh (sorry).

- You will be required to make an account on the API website in order to get an access_token. https://superheroapi.com/index.html. However, i have used mine, so feel free to skip this part.

- `The site does take roughly 15-20 seconds to fully capture all information regarding our favorite heros and villians. Please be patient.`

- To help with your impatient nature, please look at our search feature at the bottom of the screen. Please read the search feature guidance.

- Your Collection shows all the characters you have searched for in the Insert Character Name portion of the screen. Please be reminded that once you search for a character in this portion of the screen, it will immediately be added to your favorites collection. 

- Additionally, you may not clear out your collection until you hit the clear button. This button will clear all of your favorite characters (sad face).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Insert Character Name: 

This search bar is case sensitive and will only locate your favorite hero if you search it properly. Please be reminded that this feature does take 20 seconds (at most) to fully load before you can use it. 


### Your Collection

Your Collection will show all your characters with their image and name. They (at the moment) can not be double clicked to display their information. If the image is blank and no name appears, you either:
- Didnt wait for the page to load,

  or
- Didnt input the name (case sensitive) properly.


### Front of the card:

This section will display character stats; such as: Race, name, health, and power stats. If the characters information does not load properly, it is because they API that was used does not have the sufficient amount of data for this character. Feel free to google it if you really want to know. 

### Back of the card

This section will display some appearance, biography and work information. As stated above, each character will not have its information in the API used. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Searching for characters
This feature will allow you to search for your desired character using any amount of letters your require. Stuck on finding a random character? Type in a few letters or the name and you will find them quicker than you think. 

- This function does take a few seconds to load.

- `Searches do not disappear, so be wary when you hit that refresh button that your going to have to wait.`
